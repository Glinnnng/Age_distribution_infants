## Instruction for use
This project contains R codes that were used for the paper "Ling Guo, et al. Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation by chronological month of age and by birth month in infants".

Due to the restrictions on data sharing of the full study data, the study data are not shared and the full analysis cannot be replicated on GitHub. As an alternative, we have provided a working example of the Bayesian model used in this study that can run with a simulated dataset for illustration purpose.
