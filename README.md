# Study of the risk for respiratory syncytial virus associated hospitalisation by chronological month of age and by birth month in infants
This project contains R codes that were used for the paper "Ling Guo, et al. The risk for respiratory syncytial virus associated hospitalisation by chronological month of age and by birth month in infants: a global systematic analysis and development of an online prediction tool"


Considering the data licences, only the full code is shown here without the corresponding data. 
We have given simulation data in the 'working example for illustration' file, which allows to run the core code of Bayesian model.
