# Study of the risk for respiratory syncytial virus associated hospitalisation by chronological month of age and by birth month in infants
This project contains R codes that were used for the paper "Ling Guo, et al. The risk for respiratory syncytial virus associated hospitalisation by chronological month of age and by birth month in infants: a global systematic analysis and development of an online prediction tool"


Due to the restrictions on data clearance, only the full code is provided here without the corresponding data.<br>
We have included simulation data in the 'working example for illustration' file, which allows users to run the core code of the Bayesian model.
